# PERCOLATION ON BOOLEAN NETWORKS

This notebook has been created as a final project during the course Probability for Data Science under University of Verona.


Percolation theory describes how the size of clusters of connected set of edges of large random networks varies as the connectivity - i.e. the probability that two vertices are connected by an edge - changes. As the connectivity increases the system undergoes a transition from a situation where the clusters are small in size to a picture with significantly larger clusters. This transition is not smooth, but rather it happens sharply as the connectivity crosses a critical value, called percolation threshold*. The scope of the present project is to study numerically this phenomenon in Boolean networks.
